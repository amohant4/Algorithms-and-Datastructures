# Algorithms and Datastructures

This repo contains my notes and solutions to the some common data structures and algorithms related problems.
As an hardware engineer I faced a lot of hardships when I first started learning these. This is my attempt at passing on my knowledge in the most simplistic manner (I could think of) with a hope that it makes it easier for someone else.

A lot of the codes are inspired from the book: [Elements of Programing Interviews in Python](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/2017/04/03/2017-04-03-python/).
A lot of material is also obtained from [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) and [Geeksforgeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

#### Software requirements:
-- The codes and notes are writen in jupyter notebooks (for easy running of the codes and test cases).
